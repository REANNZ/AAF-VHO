## Developing and building the VHR to Shibboleth IdP integrator

#TODO

Currently opened as an eclipse project which requires Tomcat 7 and Shibboleth IDP on the project build path. The jarspec then allows eclipse to build the basic jar for us.

Really need to be ported to ant/ivy etc. That contribution would be very welcome ;-).
