Grails Plugin for Sanitizing Markup using the Antisamy library.

Project HomePage:  http://www.grails.org/plugin/sanitizer

You can add this config value to Config.groovy
sanitizer.trustSanitizer=true
By default, if there is a message given by the sanitizer during cleaning, the sanitizer codec will return an empty string.  
Setting trustSanitizer to true will allow you to ignore the messages issued by the sanitizer and just use the output.
